# Landing Page Project

The project coding aims to help  students to make dynamic pages that can react with events and make responses by functions and loops
using javascript in the front-end web development course.

This means that the main reason for making this project and giving a starter code that contains html and css is to make
students concentrate on changing this static page into interactive page rather than starting from scratch and getting into things not related to the lessons of this course.

It uses this javascript language to make dynamic navbar changes according to the number of sections and the section that is shown in the viewport on the screen window.

Number of links that are shown in the navbar are based on ***adding*** or ***removing*** sections from the code.

The navbar link changes it's ***color*** and ***styling*** with respect to if the section that appears in the viewboard is the section that belongs to this link or not.

When the link is clicked on, it navigates to the section of this link.

***On scrolling***, there will be an ***active class*** that is added to the section viewed in the viewboard and removed from other sections.

This active class adds some style to the ***active*** section.
